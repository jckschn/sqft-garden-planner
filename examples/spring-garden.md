# Example Garden Plan: Spring Garden

This is an example garden plan for a spring vegetable garden with succession planting.

## Garden Layout

### Raised Bed 1: "Spring Greens"
- **Row 1**: Lettuce (4 plants/sq) - planted March 1
- **Row 2**: Spinach (9 plants/sq) - planted March 1  
- **Row 3**: Radish (16 plants/sq) - planted March 15

### Raised Bed 2: "Early Crops"
- **Row 1**: Pea (6 plants/sq) - planted March 1
- **Row 2**: Carrot (16 plants/sq) - planted March 15
- **Row 3**: Onion (9 plants/sq) - planted March 1

## Succession Planting Schedule

**Lettuce** (45 days to maturity):
- March 1 → Harvest April 15
- March 15 → Harvest April 30
- April 1 → Harvest May 15

**Radish** (25 days to maturity):
- March 15 → Harvest April 9
- April 1 → Harvest April 26
- April 15 → Harvest May 10

## Harvest Calendar

### April
- Week 2: Radish (first planting)
- Week 3: Lettuce (first planting), Radish (second planting)

### May
- Week 1: Lettuce (second planting), Radish (third planting)
- Week 2: Pea, Lettuce (third planting)
- Week 3: Carrot
- Week 4: Spinach, Onion

## Tips

- Plant lettuce every 2 weeks for continuous harvest
- Radishes are quick - plant between slower crops
- Peas need support - add trellis
- Onions can stay in ground until tops fall over

## To Import This Plan

1. Create varieties in Vegetable Manager:
   - Lettuce → Buttercrunch
   - Spinach → Bloomsdale
   - Radish → Cherry Belle
2. Use batch planting for each row
3. Set planting dates as shown above
4. Check harvest calendar for schedule
