## 💡 Tips

### Planning Your Layout

1. **Measure your actual space** before configuring
2. **Consider access paths** - don't max out dimensions if you need walking space
3. **Start with fewer gardens** - you can always add more later
4. **Use descriptive names** - helps with organization

### Common Sizes

**Traditional raised beds:**
- 4ft × 8ft (32 sq ft) - Classic size
- 4ft × 4ft (16 sq ft) - Square bed

**Small spaces:**
- 2ft × 4ft (8 sq ft) - Balcony/patio
- 1ft × 6ft (6 sq ft) - Window box

**Large gardens:**
- 8ft × 10ft (80 sq ft) - Substantial plot
- 10ft × 10ft (100 sq ft) - Maximum size

### Succession Planting

Use multiple gardens for rotation:
```
Garden 1: Spring crops (lettuce, peas)
Garden 2: Summer crops (tomatoes, peppers)
Garden 3: Fall crops (broccoli, kale)
Garden 4: Experimental varieties
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### Before Major Changes

1. **Export your plan** (backup!)
2. **Take screenshots** if helpful
3. **Note your current dimensions**

### When Planning

1. **Measure twice, configure once**
2. **Consider your reach** (4ft is about max comfortable reach)
3. **Think about sun patterns** (tall plants in back)
4. **Plan for growth** (companion planting, succession)

### Troubleshooting

**Garden too small?**
- Minimum is 1ft × 1ft (1 square)
- Use at least 2ft × 2ft for practical planning

**Garden too large?**
- Maximum is 10ft × 10ft (100 squares)
- Consider multiple smaller gardens instead

**Lost plantings after resize?**
- Check if you have a recent export
- Unfortunately, dimension changes reset the garden
- This is why we recommend exporting first!
