### Planning Your Harvests
1. **Stagger plantings** - Plant the same crop every 2 weeks for continuous harvests
2. **Check the calendar weekly** - Plan your harvest days
3. **Watch for golden glow** - Visual reminder on your garden grid
4. **Name beds by purpose** - "Early Spring", "Summer Crops", etc.

### Using the Calendar
- **Export it!** - Take a screenshot or print for your kitchen
- **Current week** shows in green - this is what to harvest NOW
- **Past weeks** appear dimmed - track what you've already harvested
- **Group by bed** - harvest one bed at a time

### Making the Most of Visual Indicators
- Glowing dots = time to prepare harvest tools
- Check tooltips for exact dates (hover over dots)
- Plan harvests during the 7-day window
- Harvest promptly when dates pass

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: Why isn't my plant glowing?**
- Check that you've entered a planting date
- Verify days to maturity is set
- Plant must be within 7 days of harvest date

**Q: Calendar is empty**
- Add planting dates to your vegetables
- Make sure days to maturity is filled in
- Save changes (should auto-save)

**Q: Can't rename bed**
- Click directly on the bed name text
- Look for the ✏️ emoji indicating it's editable
- Try refreshing the page

**Q: Wrong harvest dates**
- Check your planting date is correct
- Verify days to maturity for that vegetable
- Dates auto-calculate, so fix the inputs
